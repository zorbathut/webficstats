# webficstats
Scrapes online webfics, then generates various informational charts.

I don't know enough about python deployment to provide good information on how to get this running. The pip requirements are included in a text file; you should . . . do the thing that makes them work?

In general, run the program, it will scrape all the stories it has listed, then generate .svg output. It caches data so you can run it regularly without redownloading everything all over again.

Please don't abuse people's sites by clearing the cache and redownloading constantly; also, please don't redistribute anyone's stories without permission.
